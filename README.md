# Landmarks
Landmarks is an application designed to help users explore and mark favorite places they love. The app combines lists, maps, and detail views in a clean, intuitive SwiftUI interface.

This app was developed as part of a hands-on study in SwiftUI, based on Apple‚Äôs official tutorial.

# Features
- **Landmark List**  
  Browse a scrollable list of landmarks with names, park, and state information.

- **Landmark Details**  
  View detailed information for each landmark, including:
  - A map (MapKit) showing its location.
  - A large image and circular thumbnail.
  - Description text and park/state info.
  - A favorite‚Äëtoggle star button.

- **Favorites Filter**  
  Filter the list to show only landmarks marked as favorites.

- **Badges & Animation**  
  Earn visual badges and enjoy subtle animations when interacting with elements like maps and favorite toggles.

- **Profile & Edit Mode**  
  Customize a user profile with editable preferences.

- **Multi‚Äëplatform Support** *(if included)*  
  Includes versions for iOS, watchOS, and macOS.

# Learnings
While building this app, I learned how to:

- Build lists (`List`, `ForEach`) and navigation between views;  
- Handle user input with toggles and buttons (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@EnvironmentObject`);
- Integrate MapKit using UIKit-bridging (`UIViewRepresentable`);
- Draw custom shapes and badges using SwiftUI `Path` and animation;
- Design a multi-platform SwiftUI app (iOS/watchOS/macOS);
